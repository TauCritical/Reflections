When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Either when working across multiple computers that don't have access to the same
networked storage or when sharing a repository with multiple people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone else has committed changes to the remote repository, there could be
unexpected conflicts with your local repository and commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks operate on github only. They take an existing github respository and make
a new github repository. Clones are similar to forks, but operate within git and
require the endpoint to be a local repository. The starting point can either be
another local repository or github. Branches operate within one repository, and
create a new 'chain' of commits eventually leading back to the same parent as
another 'branch'.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
